![Coverage](./coverage.svg)

The Typing Trainer App, inspired by [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/), helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy. Users can customize their training mode by choosing the language, punctuation, numbers, and text size. Detailed statistics are provided to track progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Demo

This is the main interface where you can set up your typing test. Customize the language, punctuation, numbers, and text size according to your preferences.
